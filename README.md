### [Change the Prototype to a New Object](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming/change-the-prototype-to-a-new-object)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
Instead of adding each prototype property one by one with `object.prototype.property`.  We can do this much easier by setting the prototype to a new object.  That way all of the prototype properties are added at once.

## HINTS 
### Hint 1
```js
Dog.prototype = {
  property: value,
  functionName: function() {}
};
```
Now try to solve the challenge!
